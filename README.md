# Grammar Components

* shapes dictionary - is a classification possible?
* rule making
* rule variation + production of output/variations
* dataset production? - how would we set it up for a joint, for a space, for an urban block?


* check how topologic - ML creates the synthetic dataset ? 
* how do we set up a set of rules, that use in the core topologic rules, to produce spaces for apartments, 
* urban blocks?- say for example barcelona -super-blocks? Timber structures? 
* recheck the Sortal Grammar how they write the rules in python -
